# Etch-A-Sketch
This project was made for a TOP project. It is a browser version of a sketchpad.

Hovering your mouse over anything makes it a random color until you hover off and increases its original opacity by 10% so your drawing will be visible.
The button at the top also lets you reset the canvas and choose a canvas size.
